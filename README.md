## Overview
Welcome to the Tennis Play Predictor! This simple web app utilizes a machine learning model, specifically a decision tree, to help you decide whether you should play tennis today. The model considers various weather factors such as humidity, outlook, temperature, and windiness to make predictions.

## Model Training
The machine learning model used in this application was trained using the notebook [playing-tennis-based-on-weather-factors.ipynb](./resources/playing-tennis-based-on-weather-factors%20(2).ipynb). In this notebook, the model pipeline was created and exported for use in the web app.

## Features
- **Decision Tree Model:** The application employs a decision tree classifier to make predictions based on input weather factors.
- **Live Demo:** Visit the [demo link](https://play-tennis-machine-learning-with-soheyb.streamlit.app/) to interact with the application and get predictions for tennis play.
